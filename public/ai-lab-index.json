Simple enough to understand. Hard to actually do.\n\nI knew the *what* but struggled with the *how*. I read widely, but my ideas felt scattered. I'd capture interesting facts, then forget them. I'd wait for inspiration that never came.\n\nAfter some reflection, I found my gaps.\n\n## The Trap: Organizing vs. Digesting\n\nI thought my problem was organization - better folders, better tags, better systems. But the framework doesn't say \"organize.\" It says \"digest.\"\n\n**Organizing is passive.** Filing things neatly.\n\n**Digesting is active.** Taking two unrelated ideas, holding them together, asking: what's the relationship? Writing down the half-formed connection even when it feels stupid.\n\nI was hoping that collecting enough material would spontaneously produce insights. That's skipping step 2 and expecting step 3 (incubation) to do all the work. It doesn't.\n\n## The Shift: Facts vs. Applications\n\nMy old habit: read something interesting, note it down, move on. Result: a graveyard of forgotten facts.\n\nThe shift: instead of capturing *what* I read, capture *when I'd use it*.\n\n\"Scale and resiliency are different\" is a fact.\n\"I'm scaling my work but not building resiliency in my personal life - this matters when I feel burnt out\" is an application.\n\nThe second version sticks because it's tagged with personal relevance. It's pre-connected to a future situation where I'll actually need it.\n\n## The \"How\" Distilled\n\n1. **Read wide** - but this is the easy part\n2. **When something resonates, ask: \"When would I use this? What situation in MY life?\"**\n3. **Write the connection, not the fact** - the application is what matters\n4. **One place** - scattered systems kill compounding; unfindable equals useless\n\n## The Real Point\n\nThe system doesn't matter. Folders, apps, workflows - just containers. The question is: \"Am I thinking better because of this?\"\n\nWriting forces clarity. Connecting forces new thinking. The output is just evidence that processing happened.\n\nThe pain of setup is worth it. But only if you're actually digesting, not just filing.\n\n---\n\n*Brainstorm with AI, 2025-01-26*\n",
