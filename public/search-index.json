And water will find its way around.\n\nIt takes effort to maintain a state. And even more to improve. Ask me, I have been trying to improve my health by running and strength training. Some years if the effort is low, I would slip back. Some years, I am able to fight back more. But there is this constant effort that I have to exert to fight back. \n\n**Life is all about trying to challenge Entropy.**\n\nAnd that is what I have learned over the years. You cannot take anything for granted. \nYour past laurels, the work that you did last year, the exercise that you did yesterday. Every day is a new day. Your past doesn't matter because Entropy will always win.\n\n\n**Keep Running**\n",

      "content": "\nIs connection everything?\n\nI read through this long time back from Steve Jobs.. \n“Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.”\n\n<!-- COMMENT: The quote defines creativity as 'connecting things.' For analytical clarity, specify the nature of these 'things.' Are they discrete pieces of information, concepts, observations, or experiences? Additionally, define the 'connection' operation. Is it pattern recognition, synthesis, juxtaposition, or something else? Articulating this mechanistic view would clarify the input components and the transformation process. -->\n\nAnd I was also reading this article - https://timelessinsights.pages.dev/article/a-technique-for-producing-ideas from fs.blog originally. \n\n<!-- COMMENT: The statement 'I find it very interesting on the whole thought process' is subjective and lacks specificity. To enhance reasoning quality, identify the specific aspects of the thought process that are interesting. For instance, what particular techniques, constraints, or emergent properties of the system for producing ideas resonated? Pinpointing these details would provide a clearer foundation for subsequent arguments.\n\nThe analogy 'kids are such free thinkers... until school kills their creativity' requires expansion. To make this comparable to a technical system, describe the specific mechanisms by which 'school' or 'parents' act as external constraints or filters. What are the input parameters (e.g., diverse stimuli, open-ended problem statements) that are present in the 'free thinker' state and subsequently removed or restricted? What are the operational changes (e.g., rigid curricula, conformity pressures) that lead to a degradation in 'creativity' (defined as the rate or novelty of idea generation) in this analogy? Providing a mapping to system-level concepts like input diversity, processing constraints, or output variability would strengthen the analytical link. -->\n\nI find it very interesting on the whole thought process... I keep connecting it to how kids are such free thinkers and probably natural at it - until school kills their creativity to some extend parents too. I remeber another book from Seth Godin - https://seths.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stop-stealing-dreams6print.pdf. \n\n\nSome of the best entrepreneurs were information guzzlers and used to read a lot. \nThere is another book around it i am trying to go through- SEEKING WISDOM From Darwin to Munger By Peter Bevelin. I read wide, but I am not particularly good at organizing my thoughts at one place.\n\n<!-- COMMENT: The assertion 'Some of the best entrepreneurs were information guzzlers and used to read a lot' establishes a correlation. To provide a deeper analytical insight, elaborate on the causal mechanism. How does 'information guzzling' (high-volume data ingestion) translate into improved idea generation or successful entrepreneurship? Does it increase the probability of novel connections, provide a broader dataset for pattern matching, or reduce the cost of information retrieval? Consider discussing the required information processing capacity and potential bottlenecks (e.g., information overload, signal-to-noise ratio degradation) in such a system.\n\nThe personal observation 'I read wide, but I am not particularly good at organizing my thoughts at one place' identifies a system constraint. This could be framed as a processing bottleneck within the idea generation system. What are the specific failure modes associated with disorganization (e.g., difficulty retrieving related concepts, increased latency in forming connections, reduced combinatorial efficiency)? What are the functional requirements for an effective 'thought organization' subsystem, and how might its absence impact the overall throughput or quality of produced ideas? -->\n\n\n\n\n",

They are actually different paradigms all together.\n\n**But then why is this question**\nBecause there is a tendency to think they are same. Due to when they show up and sometimes the common solution for both. \n\nScale challenges and Resiliency problems show up almost always when systems are under load. Systems at limits, tends to expose points of failures. And additional capacities can help mitigate the symptoms for sometime but not always.\n\n<!-- COMMENT: This paragraph sets up the conflation well, but consider being more explicit about WHY capacity doesn't solve resilience: it may mask the SPOF temporarily but doesn't eliminate it. A VM scaling out doesn't help if the region fails. -->\n\n**What they really are**\nIn general - scale is \"more\". And resilience is for \"worse\".\n\n<!-- COMMENT: These definitions are compressed. Consider: Scale = handling increased volume/throughput. Resilience = continuing operation despite component failure. The tech example below will make this clearer, but upfront precision helps. -->\n\nConsider a common restaurant example. Lets consider that there is a relatively new place - which has become popular. And on a specific festival night, there is a lot of expected crowd. The owner expected and got few temporary kitchen staff for the night. That is scaling. And they have got by with that more than a few times. \n\n<!-- COMMENT: You mentioned you're more naturally a tech scale person. Consider replacing this with a VM/region example: \n- Scaling: Auto-scaling group adds instances during peak load\n- Resilience: Multi-region deployment survives when us-east-1 fails\nThe restaurant works, but if tech infrastructure is your native language, it'll be stronger and more credible. -->\n\nIn their supply chain though - they had a single dairy provider. And their truck broke today on the road. It had never happened before - the partner was wildly punctual and had standby trucks. But during festival days - they were running above limit. Eventually they couldn't serve the most demanded shakes and cheese sandwiches. That is failure to be resilient. They didn't have an alternate. And it showed up more because system was under full load. And you can say the overall region had more load which created a ripple effect.\n\n\n**Life requires balancing Scaling and Resiliency**\n\nScaling by definition allows you to do more. While Resiliency is allowing you to keep doing stuff even at some minimum pace.\nIn our above example if the restaurant had some redundancy - backup supplier, or additional stock kicked in at such times. They could have kept the restaurant running even at slightly lower capacity, till the main supplier fixes their truck and delivers a delayed shipment.\n\nOne of the best way to distinguish for me is to see what systems are more critical then others. If the system is critical - stability is more important than scale. We would love to have redundancies and scale at the same time. But we always calculate the return that we get out from it.\n\n<!-- COMMENT: Good, but you could add: the cost isn't just economic—redundancy introduces operational complexity (monitoring, failover logic, sync overhead). Also, consider mentioning failure probability as a factor: low-probability, high-impact failures often justify resilience investment even if utilization is currently low. -->\n\nThis is also so true for us humans. Life has many facets, and we decide what is critical and what is not. We need to prioritize and decide where scale is important, and what is the minimum SLA we need for which facet. Unlike machines, there is limit of redundancies and scale humans can provide.\n\n<!-- COMMENT: The human analogy you proposed makes sense conceptually: \"scaling too much at office leaves no resilience for home\" = allocating all capacity to one domain leaves no buffer for others. But this section needs concrete grounding:\n\nOption 1: Use specific examples\n- Scale at work: taking on more projects, longer hours\n- Resilience gap: when family emergency hits, you have no slack capacity (time, energy, attention)\n- The trade-off: you can't have infinite redundancy in life, so you pick where to build buffers (savings, relationships, health)\n\nOption 2: Map the technical concepts explicitly\n- Time/energy = finite capacity (like CPU/memory)\n- Oversubscription in one area = no headroom for unexpected load in another\n- Building resilience = maintaining slack capacity across critical life domains\n\nWithout this grounding, \"minimum SLA for a life facet\" reads as vague/motivational rather than analytical. If you map it clearly to the technical concepts, it becomes a genuine insight about resource allocation under constraints.\n\nQuestion: Do you want the human section to mirror the technical reasoning closely (explicit capacity/buffer mapping), or keep it looser but with concrete examples? -->\n\n\n**Pick where you should be resilient**\n\n<!-- COMMENT: This heading has no content.
