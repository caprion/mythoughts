And water will find its way around.\n\nIt takes effort to maintain a state. And even more to improve. Ask me, I have been trying to improve my health by running and strength training. Some years if the effort is low, I would slip back. Some years, I am able to fight back more. But there is this constant effort that I have to exert to fight back. \n\n**Life is all about trying to challenge Entropy.**\n\nAnd that is what I have learned over the years. You cannot take anything for granted. \nYour past laurels, the work that you did last year, the exercise that you did yesterday. Every day is a new day. Your past doesn't matter because Entropy will always win.\n\n\n**Keep Running**",
      "summary": "All systems naturally tend towards disorder, requiring continuous and proactive effort to maintain any state, achieve improvement, or counteract the inherent force of decay, akin to fighting entropy.",

        "Acknowledge that any achievement or state will degrade without sustained, continuous effort.",
        "Understand that past successes do not guarantee future maintenance or improvement; daily effort is essential.",
        "Develop a mindset of constant struggle and proactive investment to counteract natural entropy in all aspects of life."
