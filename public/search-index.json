      "content": "\n**In the end, you will always loose.**\n\nYep. that's the truth. You keep a block of ice long enough in a room and it would melt. And water will find its way around.\n\nIt takes effort to maintain a state. And even more to improve. Ask me, I have been trying to improve my health by running and strength training. Some years if the effort is low, I would slip back. Some years, I am able to fight back more. But there is this constant effort that I have to exert to fight back. \n\n**Life is all about trying to challenge Entropy.**\n\nAnd that is what I have learned over the years. You cannot take anything for granted. \nYour past laurels, the work that you did last year, the exercise that you did yesterday. Every day is a new day. Your past doesn't matter because Entropy will always win.\n\n\n**Keep Running**\n",
      "insight": "Life is a continuous struggle against entropy; constant effort is needed to maintain and improve.",
      "summary": "Entropy dictates that all systems naturally tend towards disorder and decay. Counteracting this universal force requires constant, ongoing effort to maintain existing states and achieve improvements, as past achievements do not guarantee future stability.",
      "highlights": [
        "Maintenance and improvement always require continuous, active effort.",
        "Past achievements do not exempt you from present and future work.",
        "Recognize entropy's relentless push and commit to ongoing action."
