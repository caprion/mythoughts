And water will find its way around.\n\nIt takes effort to maintain a state. And even more to improve. Ask me, I have been trying to improve my health by running and strength training. Some years if the effort is low, I would slip back. Some years, I am able to fight back more. But there is this constant effort that I have to exert to fight back. \n\n**Life is all about trying to challenge Entropy.**\n\nAnd that is what I have learned over the years. You cannot take anything for granted. \nYour past laurels, the work that you did last year, the exercise that you did yesterday. Every day is a new day. Your past doesn't matter because Entropy will always win.\n\n\n**Keep Running**\n",

      "content": "\nIs connection everything?\n\nI read through this long time back from Steve Jobs.. \n“Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.”\n\nIf you saw Money ball, the connection comes from simple statistics way of looking at team rather than qualitative talent. This is the sort of connection Steve seems to be talking about. The famous scene - \"because he gets on base\" shows how a team with little money had to connect dots somewhere to challenge the whole league way of doing things. And eventually changing it for good.\n\nSome of this discussion triggered after reading this article - https://timelessinsights.pages.dev/article/a-technique-for-producing-ideas from fs.blog originally. Education and how we go about always gets me excited. Kids are natural free thinkers. And sometimes schools are an antidote of it - For e.g. schools asks kids not to make mistakes, not collaborate with one another, change context frequently every hour. Seth Godin has a great book https://seths.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stop-stealing-dreams6print.pdf. But I digress i think.\n\nBack to original point. When Carl Newport talks about what creates impact and how you measure it, he talks about Leading metrics and Lagging metrics. He talks about his work on how many papers he can publish in journal. And his leading metrics be amount of focussed time he was able to spend week on week.\nI believe if you put that in perspective - at early age, reading and comprehension is a key for most kids. \n\nSome of the best entrepreneurs were voraious readers by choice or chance. Bill Gates is known to hang around with books early in his career, a pattern he follows to this day. Munger talks about the importance of reading. And Naval Ravikant talked about how he was a latch key kid and how that made him spent hours in library everyday reading without adult supervision - which was a nice thing, as he was able to read wide and figure out what works for him.\n\nReading is the process gathering material. Then it needs to be understood and digested well. Before the concepts can be applied to other domains as one continue to dive deep into multiple domains. But is connection everything. Would you be able to connect most of the ideas or any idea. It is impossible to know that. But the more time you spend, the more you are inside the goldilocks zone for connections to happen. As always - connections are by products. The journey is what matters.",

      "content": "\n**Scale and Resilience. Are they same**\n\nNo they aren't. They are actually different paradigms all together.\n\n**But then why is this question**\nBecause there is a tendency to think they are same. Due to when they show up and sometimes the common solution for both. \n\nScale challenges and Resiliency problems show up almost always when systems are under load. Systems at limits, tends to expose points of failures. And additional capacities can help mitigate the symptoms for sometime but not always.\n\n<!-- COMMENT: This paragraph sets up the conflation well, but consider being more explicit about WHY capacity doesn't solve resilience: it may mask the SPOF temporarily but doesn't eliminate it. A VM scaling out doesn't help if the region fails. -->\n\n**What they really are**\nIn general - scale is \"more\". And resilience is for \"worse\".\n\n<!-- COMMENT: These definitions are compressed. Consider: Scale = handling increased volume/throughput. Resilience = continuing operation despite component failure. The tech example below will make this clearer, but upfront precision helps. -->\n\nConsider a common restaurant example. Lets consider that there is a relatively new place - which has become popular. And on a specific festival night, there is a lot of expected crowd. The owner expected and got few temporary kitchen staff for the night. That is scaling. And they have got by with that more than a few times. \n\n<!-- COMMENT: You mentioned you're more naturally a tech scale person. Consider replacing this with a VM/region example: \n- Scaling: Auto-scaling group adds instances during peak load\n- Resilience: Multi-region deployment survives when us-east-1 fails\nThe restaurant works, but if tech infrastructure is your native language, it'll be stronger and more credible. -->\n\nIn their supply chain though - they had a single dairy provider. And their truck broke today on the road. It had never happened before - the partner was wildly punctual and had standby trucks. But during festival days - they were running above limit. Eventually they couldn't serve the most demanded shakes and cheese sandwiches. That is failure to be resilient. They didn't have an alternate. And it showed up more because system was under full load. And you can say the overall region had more load which created a ripple effect.\n\n\n**Life requires balancing Scaling and Resiliency**\n\nScaling by definition allows you to do more. While Resiliency is allowing you to keep doing stuff even at some minimum pace.\nIn our above example if the restaurant had some redundancy - backup supplier, or additional stock kicked in at such times. They could have kept the restaurant running even at slightly lower capacity, till the main supplier fixes their truck and delivers a delayed shipment.\n\nOne of the best way to distinguish for me is to see what systems are more critical then others. If the system is critical - stability is more important than scale. We would love to have redundancies and scale at the same time. But we always calculate the return that we get out from it.\n\n<!-- COMMENT: Good, but you could add: the cost isn't just economic—redundancy introduces operational complexity (monitoring, failover logic, sync overhead). Also, consider mentioning failure probability as a factor: low-probability, high-impact failures often justify resilience investment even if utilization is currently low. -->\n\nThis is also so true for us humans. Life has many facets, and we decide what is critical and what is not. We need to prioritize and decide where scale is important, and what is the minimum SLA we need for which facet. Unlike machines, there is limit of redundancies and scale humans can provide.\n\n<!-- COMMENT: The human analogy you proposed makes sense conceptually: \"scaling too much at office leaves no resilience for home\" = allocating all capacity to one domain leaves no buffer for others. But this section needs concrete grounding:\n\nOption 1: Use specific examples\n- Scale at work: taking on more projects, longer hours\n- Resilience gap: when family emergency hits, you have no slack capacity (time, energy, attention)\n- The trade-off: you can't have infinite redundancy in life, so you pick where to build buffers (savings, relationships, health)\n\nOption 2: Map the technical concepts explicitly\n- Time/energy = finite capacity (like CPU/memory)\n- Oversubscription in one area = no headroom for unexpected load in another\n- Building resilience = maintaining slack capacity across critical life domains\n\nWithout this grounding, \"minimum SLA for a life facet\" reads as vague/motivational rather than analytical. If you map it clearly to the technical concepts, it becomes a genuine insight about resource allocation under constraints.\n\nQuestion: Do you want the human section to mirror the technical reasoning closely (explicit capacity/buffer mapping), or keep it looser but with concrete examples? -->\n\n\n**Pick where you should be resilient**\n\n<!-- COMMENT: This heading has no content.
