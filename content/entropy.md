summary: >-
  Entropy dictates that all systems naturally tend towards disorder and decay.
  Counteracting this universal force requires constant, ongoing effort to
  maintain existing states and achieve improvements, as past achievements do not
  guarantee future stability.
highlights:
  - 'Maintenance and improvement always require continuous, active effort.'
  - Past achievements do not exempt you from present and future work.
  - Recognize entropy's relentless push and commit to ongoing action.

scope: >-
  This insight applies universally to all systems, from physical objects to
  personal health and professional achievements, where inaction leads to
  degradation.
anti_pattern: >-
  People commonly misapply this by assuming past success guarantees future
  stability, or that a desired state can be maintained without ongoing effort.

  maintain and improve.

**In the end, you will always loose.**

Yep. that's the truth. You keep a block of ice long enough in a room and it would melt. And water will find its way around.

It takes effort to maintain a state. And even more to improve. Ask me, I have been trying to improve my health by running and strength training. Some years if the effort is low, I would slip back. Some years, I am able to fight back more. But there is this constant effort that I have to exert to fight back. 

**Life is all about trying to challenge Entropy.**

And that is what I have learned over the years. You cannot take anything for granted. 
Your past laurels, the work that you did last year, the exercise that you did yesterday. Every day is a new day. Your past doesn't matter because Entropy will always win.


**Keep Running**
