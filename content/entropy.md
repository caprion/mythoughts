summary: >-
  All systems naturally tend towards disorder, requiring continuous and
  proactive effort to maintain any state, achieve improvement, or counteract the
  inherent force of decay, akin to fighting entropy.
highlights:
  - >-
    Acknowledge that any achievement or state will degrade without sustained,
    continuous effort.
  - >-
    Understand that past successes do not guarantee future maintenance or
    improvement; daily effort is essential.
  - >-
    Develop a mindset of constant struggle and proactive investment to
    counteract natural entropy in all aspects of life.

**In the end, you will always loose.**

Yep. that's the truth. You keep a block of ice long enough in a room and it would melt. And water will find its way around.

It takes effort to maintain a state. And even more to improve. Ask me, I have been trying to improve my health by running and strength training. Some years if the effort is low, I would slip back. Some years, I am able to fight back more. But there is this constant effort that I have to exert to fight back. 

**Life is all about trying to challenge Entropy.**

And that is what I have learned over the years. You cannot take anything for granted. 
Your past laurels, the work that you did last year, the exercise that you did yesterday. Every day is a new day. Your past doesn't matter because Entropy will always win.


**Keep Running**
