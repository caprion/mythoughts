Is connection everything?

I read through this long time back from Steve Jobs.. 
“Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.”

<!-- COMMENT: The quote defines creativity as 'connecting things.' For analytical clarity, specify the nature of these 'things.' Are they discrete pieces of information, concepts, observations, or experiences? Additionally, define the 'connection' operation. Is it pattern recognition, synthesis, juxtaposition, or something else? Articulating this mechanistic view would clarify the input components and the transformation process. -->

And I was also reading this article - https://timelessinsights.pages.dev/article/a-technique-for-producing-ideas from fs.blog originally. 

<!-- COMMENT: The statement 'I find it very interesting on the whole thought process' is subjective and lacks specificity. To enhance reasoning quality, identify the specific aspects of the thought process that are interesting. For instance, what particular techniques, constraints, or emergent properties of the system for producing ideas resonated? Pinpointing these details would provide a clearer foundation for subsequent arguments.

The analogy 'kids are such free thinkers... until school kills their creativity' requires expansion. To make this comparable to a technical system, describe the specific mechanisms by which 'school' or 'parents' act as external constraints or filters. What are the input parameters (e.g., diverse stimuli, open-ended problem statements) that are present in the 'free thinker' state and subsequently removed or restricted? What are the operational changes (e.g., rigid curricula, conformity pressures) that lead to a degradation in 'creativity' (defined as the rate or novelty of idea generation) in this analogy? Providing a mapping to system-level concepts like input diversity, processing constraints, or output variability would strengthen the analytical link. -->

I find it very interesting on the whole thought process... I keep connecting it to how kids are such free thinkers and probably natural at it - until school kills their creativity to some extend parents too. I remeber another book from Seth Godin - https://seths.blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/stop-stealing-dreams6print.pdf. 


Some of the best entrepreneurs were information guzzlers and used to read a lot. 
There is another book around it i am trying to go through- SEEKING WISDOM From Darwin to Munger By Peter Bevelin. I read wide, but I am not particularly good at organizing my thoughts at one place.

<!-- COMMENT: The assertion 'Some of the best entrepreneurs were information guzzlers and used to read a lot' establishes a correlation. To provide a deeper analytical insight, elaborate on the causal mechanism. How does 'information guzzling' (high-volume data ingestion) translate into improved idea generation or successful entrepreneurship? Does it increase the probability of novel connections, provide a broader dataset for pattern matching, or reduce the cost of information retrieval? Consider discussing the required information processing capacity and potential bottlenecks (e.g., information overload, signal-to-noise ratio degradation) in such a system.

The personal observation 'I read wide, but I am not particularly good at organizing my thoughts at one place' identifies a system constraint. This could be framed as a processing bottleneck within the idea generation system. What are the specific failure modes associated with disorganization (e.g., difficulty retrieving related concepts, increased latency in forming connections, reduced combinatorial efficiency)? What are the functional requirements for an effective 'thought organization' subsystem, and how might its absence impact the overall throughput or quality of produced ideas? -->
